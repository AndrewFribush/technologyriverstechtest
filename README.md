This is the tech test for MemoryWell. Thanks for your time. I know these aren't the most fun in the world, but we'll be through it soon!

Your job is to develop and deploy a simple app. It needs to have a sign up and log in. There are two types of users, one type can upload multiple photos. Each upload creates a list of photos. The photos in these lists can be reordered. The other user can see the lists and reorder the stories but not delete them or upload anything. Once it's done, deploy it to heroku.

The gems you need should already be in the app. You won't lose points for adding or replacing but I'll ask why. Please record how long the exercise takes you and send that over.
